#Each command takes one row
#Declare a player via [name]
#Do not declare multiple players with the same name. There are no checks for this.
#Write results of a game via [name of winner] [name of loser]
#Write > [name] to suspend a player. They will no longer be matched for games
#Write < [name] to unsusped a player
#Comments can be written after #, row must not contain a command
#"end" denotes the end of input. Calculations will be made.

#"Nobody" is a reserved player in matchups with an odd number of players. 
#This player can't gain wins, but can be played.
#Never declare Nobody; it will generate a non-Nobody player with Nobody's name
#By winning/losing vs Nobody, players will not be singled out again
#You can technically suspend Nobody, but please don't
